I was invited to join this (the last) week a hackathon! It was so fun!

We tried to build a superfridge.. Face-recognition, bottle-counting (in and out), auto-prefill new flaschenpost-order and better invoicing.

Why that all? Cause its fun!! :D And no one wants to put lines on a paper while having one or more bottles in their hands .. ;)

Got really close to our goal.. counting the bottles was not that easy as thought..

My personal goals for the week: 

- design a 3d enclosure
- getting started with react and nextjs

My personal goals were fullfilled, enjoyed it!

We maybe will continue on it.. I will upload a video during the next days =)

Another stupid DHL/Post case popped up..

![tracking zagreb](../images/zagreb_6_weeks_wo_event.png){width=600px}

It finally arrived.. Got feedback via Mail! :)

![feedback](../images/zagreb_mail.png){width=600px}

.. BUT .. 6 weeks after shipping started.. without ANY event fired..

What do we learn..

1. DHL has huge problems while delivering
2. the tracking system IS NOT working

==> PLEASE JUST BE PATIENT.. PACKAGES ARRIVE.. sooner or LATER =//

While opening re-search tasks on DHL.. The number of "normal days without an event" was increased to 19 days in non EU!! :D
What the hell ..

And one parcel moved today.. after 17 days of chilling ^^ at least without firing any event in between..

The worst story ever.. fasten your seatbelts .. ;D

Germany to Hungary.. Sadly one of the first packages.. Without tracking.. Took more than 60 !! days.. Even the resend parcel was there before! ;D

And guess what.. The envelope was totally destroyed and, for sure, empty.. Dear Post.. Why do you even deliver something like that?? Come on..

I am on a business trip this week. But during some meetings and in the evenings I started to build a small tool to gather all tracking-infos from our parcels.

It seems that it's working quite nice.. Found around 20 parcels with event's older than 10 days.. 

Started already re-search tasks for those parcels! Happy to tell you, that I can keep an eye on those cases now! ;)

Long time no see.. :D

What happened during the last weeks, besides from testing, packing and shipping sticks :)

We got managed to build some tools which will help us and optimize our processes!

- We are now able to automatically read the tracking-no from the PDFs generated by DHL. And feed them back into Tindie's portal.
- Invoices and DHL stickers are now printed automatically.
- I build a small tool which uses OCR to get all the "old" tracking no's from our scanned DHL-invoices and send them via email to you!

Due to another business trip I am planning the next batches and trying to close the shop only a few days!

What does not change? DHL has massive problems.. Tracking is not working properly.. Events are rarely popping up.. Really annoying! Please be patient. Luckily we can track now! ;)

The guy living in my old flat contacted me.. He received another big trash-can full of destroyed and partially empty envelopes.
Seems like that nearly half of the shipped parcels (from two shipping waves) were included.. :fontawesome-regular-angry:

Started talking to my local post office once the first of you received an envelope in really bad condition!
Finally, they gave me some coupons and a special offer to add tracking to international shipments! At least for the EU, let's see how far we can get..

Still re-ordering all the envelopes, tracking back to the original orders and testing+repacking those things..

Finally found a student who will help me (since my colleague is in vacation)!!

# 29. Aug' 2020

Today we will move to another flat. (Within cologne too)
So much to do.. :(

(What a stupid german thing.. not married before 30? Clean your court.. ^^)

# 20. Aug' 2020

God damn post.. Today I received plenty of destroyed and empty envelopes back! :fontawesome-regular-surprise:

![destroyed envelopes](../images/destroyed_env.jpg){width=200px}

Some of you guys already mentioned that you received them in nearly the same condition.. Most of the are already re-shipped!

I have to sort those envelopes, test the remaining devices again and see where we get and how fast we can re-pack them!

# 18. Aug' 2020

Finally arrived back home! :fontawesome-regular-paper-plane:

Let the night-shift's begin..
